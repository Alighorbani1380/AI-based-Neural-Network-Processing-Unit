# AI-based Neural Network Processing Unit

Welcome to the repository for **Exercise 3 of the AI Systems Course** at the **University of Tehran**.  
This project focuses on designing and implementing a lightweight, efficient **processing element (PE)** for performing operations of neurons in a **multi-layer perceptron (MLP)** using Verilog.
